An object-fit polyfill for videos.

## Instalation
Use
`npm install video-fit-polyfill`

## Usage
For magic:
1. import it
2. use ***fit-video** as class in all the videos you want.

If you prefer use your own selector, import the function and added as below.

If the browser supports object-fit it won't do anything.
